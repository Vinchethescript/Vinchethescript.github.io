# my website
this is the github repo of my website :D


the background and the stars I used in my site have been taken the from the
[Debian GNU/Linux 6 (squeeze) design](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDesktop/Artwork/Squeeze),
["SpaceFun"](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianArt/Themes/SpaceFun), and have been animated by me.
